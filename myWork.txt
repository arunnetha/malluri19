Worked on prototyping a Rancher cluster to manage downstream clusters
Integrate Rancher with AD
You can manage the entire range of clusters from this interface.
can use commad line too

Open shift
Prepare the cluster(install required tools via helm,
 longhorn for persistant storage(DB), 
 Kafka for messaging,
 Grafana for logging, 
 ELK Stack(Elasticsearch(a document DB to search logs etc.,), 
			Logstash pumps in data to Elastic Search and 
			Kibana is used to visualize the data),
 Twistlock to identify security vulnarabilities
 Istio service mesh for traffic, policy and telemetry 
 CSI divers (container storage interface to read secrets from keyvault)
 
 
 Created devops pipelines to build the solution, generate an image, store in the repository, generate deployment Yamls per environment
 used templates for build and deployment sections so multiple applications can use the same format.
 Configured gitops with flux to ensure changes to workload yamls gets deployed to cluster
 
 
WALGREENS


created the AKS foundation 
Used Terraforms to setup the environment.(init, plan, apply) DSC 
Azure devops for sourcecode/build/deploy
Had prebuilt workloads which have to be modified(shell scripting /sed) as per the environment using shell scripting and deploy the same to the cluster.
Monitoring and trouble shooting
Ensure the correct keys/secrets are used based on the environment.
This involves interacting with the client team to get the right information.
